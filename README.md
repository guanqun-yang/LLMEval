When working on a new project, make sure update the 
`setting.py` and `setup.py` files.

- `setting.py`: global absolute paths and paths for 
  model checkpoints and datasets.
- `setup.py`: the local installation name. The name has 
  to be updated to make sure the names within the 
  current folder could be imported.
